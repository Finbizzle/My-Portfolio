        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 125%;">To the left is an image I made to replicate a magazine cover. To make this I used photoshop along with photos I took myself to put together the full image. I chose to make a fake music magazine because music means a lot to me and I wanted to express that with my magazine. During this project I was tasked with adding several items to the image to make it look more like an actual magazine cover. </p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 125%;">To the right is a class poster that I made while working with some of my classmates. We took individual images of our classmates and put them all together in Photoshop, along with other images, to make the whole poster. This project really helped me build some teamwork skills while working with my class, and it was a really fun experience. To make the poster we started by storyboarding with an image of the two couches, plotting out where each person was going to go and what position they would be in. Then, we took photos of everyone in their correct positions and edited them onto the couch. We added a few other things but most importantly everyone had a say in how they were displayed on the poster.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size:125%;">To the right is an image of a lion that I made with Adobe Illustrator. To do this project I was assigned an animal that I had to find an image of, so I found an image of a lion. After that I had to replace the different parts of the lions face with polygons. This project helped me get familiar with how Adobe Illustrator works and work with planning on where the polygons will go. Personally I really liked this project, it was a relaxing and enjoyable way to use Adobe Illustrator and figure out how all of the different tools work.</p>
